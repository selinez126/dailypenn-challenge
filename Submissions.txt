1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?
~10 hrs. I spent some time beforehand reviewing jQuery and just everything in general.

2. Describe the features you have implemented.
All the required features:
- display questions based on data (checkboxes with associated labels)
- button for show result and retake quiz
- select result based on which has most response (or is earlier in alphabet)
Also:
- a lot of styling with the options and changing the look based on hover, checked, etc.
- tried so hard to make it an exact replica haha (pretty much the only thing I didn’t do is style disabled checkboxes)

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
I had the most trouble with creating checkboxes within labels and identifying which goes with which to access the data upon submit and also do CSS.
I addressed this by creating classes/ids that could be accessed and used the toggleClass method.
 - Since a parent can’t change because of a child (hmm kind of like the quiz topic), a label can’t change based on a checkbox; radio buttons might’ve been much nicer.
It was also challenging to deal with the state of the submit/reset button and associated changes, for which tracing the code step by step to debug helped.

4. How much time can you spend each week working for DP Developers?
Around 8 seems very doable, but my schedule’s pretty flexible.
